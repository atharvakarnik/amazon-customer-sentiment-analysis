# Practical Data Science using AWS

This repository contains the projects and assignments completed as part of the **Practical Data Science using AWS** specialization offered by deeplearning.ai and AWS. The coursework focuses on applying data science principles using AWS tools and services.

## Overview

This specialization covers the following key areas:

1. **Data Collection and Storage**: 
   - Utilized AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift to store and manage datasets efficiently.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Employed AWS Glue and Amazon SageMaker for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Built, trained, and evaluated machine learning models using Amazon SageMaker, exploring various algorithms and techniques.

4. **Deployment and Monitoring**:
   - Implemented models in production environments, using AWS tools for deployment, monitoring, and optimization.
